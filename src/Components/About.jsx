      <p>
        This React app was created to showcase the use of React Router for
        navigation. It includes two pages - Home and About.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Home page welcomes users to the app and provides a link to the About
        page. The About page, in turn, displays information about the
        application.
      </p>
      <p>Feel free to explore and enjoy our React app!</p>
